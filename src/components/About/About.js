                    <p>Though exploration is often associated with places, at its very heart, 
                    it’s about the people. For nearly 70 years, the person-to-person experience has 
                    been at the very core of Liberty Travel’s mission. It’s what we’ve always done and 
                    it’s what we do now. Real people helping real people. Beside you every step of the way.
                    </p>
